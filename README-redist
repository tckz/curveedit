 * Brantley Harris wrote this plugin. It is based somewhat on the JSON.org 
 * website's http://www.json.org/json2.js, which proclaims:
 * "NO WARRANTY EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.", a sentiment that
 * I uphold.
 *
 * It is also influenced heavily by MochiKit's serializeJSON, which is 
 * copyrighted 2005 by Bob Ippolito.
